description: Find best name
---

Goal is to find best name for: $ARGUMENTS

Name should be:
- simplest (shortest) possible (but 2-3 words are still OK, max 4 words if needed for complex names)
- the most intuitive from developer perspective - should reflect the real meaning or nature of the thing
- descriptive = name should really reflect the reality behind that name - like it should reflect what the thing is about / what is inside the variable / what is the function doing / what is the class about / ...
-

Do these steps:
1. Suggest 15 high quality names
2. Score each name them by simplicity, intuitiveness, and descriptive power
3. Show them in table ordered by total score
4. Prepare final recommendation
