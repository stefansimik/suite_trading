    Public API used by broker/matching engine and any consumer that needs to extract
    price observations from heterogeneous event types (bars, trade ticks, quote ticks).

    Implementations must yield deterministic sequences of `PriceSample` items.

    Notes:
    - No additional getters are required; each `PriceSample` includes instrument and time.
    - Bars should not expose OHLC semantics here; use `PriceSample.price_type` instead.
