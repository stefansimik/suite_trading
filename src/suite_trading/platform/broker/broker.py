    """Protocol for brokers.

    The @runtime_checkable decorator from Python's typing module allows you to use
    isinstance() and issubclass() checks with Protocol classes at runtime.

    This protocol defines the interface that brokers must implement
    to handle core brokerage operations including:
    - Connection management (connect, disconnect, status checking)
    - Order management (submitting, canceling, modifying, and retrieving orders)
    - Position tracking (retrieving current positions)

    Brokers serve as the bridge between trading strategies and
    actual broker/exchange systems, handling essential trading operations.
