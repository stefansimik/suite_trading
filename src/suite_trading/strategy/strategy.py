class Strategy(ABC):
    """Base class for all trading strategies with independent timeline management.

    **Timeline Isolation:**
    Each Strategy operates with its own independent timeline, completely isolated from other
    strategies' timelines. This means:

    - **No Global Time Synchronization**: There is no global time that syncs across all strategies
    - **Independent Event Processing**: Each strategy processes events at its own pace and timeline
    - **Flexible Time Ranges**: Strategies can process different time periods simultaneously
    - **Mixed Execution Modes**: Historical backtests and live strategies can run together

    **Benefits:**
    - Run multiple historical backtests with different time periods simultaneously
    - Combine live trading strategies with historical analysis strategies
    - Each strategy maintains its own `last_event_time` based on the last processed event
    - Strategies never interfere with each other's timeline progression

    **Example Use Cases:**
    - Strategy A: Historical backtest from 2020-2023
    - Strategy B: Live trading starting from current time
    - Strategy C: Historical analysis from 2019-2021
    - All three can run simultaneously, each with their own timeline
