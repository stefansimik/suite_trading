    This state machine accepts state transition definitions as a dictionary

    functionality to check if the current state is terminal (has no outgoing transitions).

    Example:
        ```python
        # Define your states and actions
        class OrderState(State):
            PENDING = "PENDING"
            SUBMITTED = "SUBMITTED"
            FILLED = "FILLED"
            CANCELLED = "CANCELLED"

        class OrderAction(Action):
            SUBMIT = "SUBMIT"
            FILL = "FILL"
            CANCEL = "CANCEL"

        # Define transitions - direct dictionary structure
        transitions = {
            (OrderState.PENDING, OrderAction.SUBMIT): OrderState.SUBMITTED,
            (OrderState.SUBMITTED, OrderAction.FILL): OrderState.FILLED,
            (OrderState.SUBMITTED, OrderAction.CANCEL): OrderState.CANCELLED,
        }

        # Create and use the state machine
        sm = StateMachine(OrderState.PENDING, transitions)
        sm.execute_action(OrderAction.SUBMIT)  # State becomes SUBMITTED

        # Check if in terminal state
        print(sm.is_in_terminal_state())  # False - SUBMITTED has outgoing transitions
